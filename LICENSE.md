License for the SOFTWARE fScout (File Search engine for Cross Operating system with UI but also for Terminal)


###Preamble

The Fairware License is designed to promote open collaboration and knowledge sharing while ensuring fair compensation for contributions when the SOFTWARE is used commercially.

This license enables individuals to use and contribute to the SOFTWARE for personal, academic, and research purposes at no cost, fostering an environment of transparency and support. It harnesses the synergies of open-source development through shared insights and peer reviews, while also recognizing the value of the work involved.

By using this license, we aim to create a community where everyone can benefit from the collective effort, while also ensuring that commercial use is accompanied by appropriate compensation for both the original developers and contributors. This approach balances the principles of openness with the need for sustainable support for ongoing development.


### Personal, Academic, and Research Use

Permission is hereby granted to any person obtaining a copy of this software to download, install, use, and copy the SOFTWARE for personal, academic, or research purposes free of charge.

### Commercial Use

For commercial purposes, including but not limited to incorporation into proprietary software, offering as a service, or use in a commercial product or business, a paid license must be obtained from Jakobimatrix. Commercial use without an express paid license is prohibited.

### Contributions and Revenue Sharing

By contributing to this project, each contributor agrees:

1. To transfer copyright ownership of their contributions to the OWNER.

2. To be eligible for a fair share of any revenue generated from commercial licenses of the SOFTWARE, proportional to the size or significance of their contributions.

3. The OWNER will determine the fair share for each contributor based on the significance of their contributions. This distribution will be updated and shared with all contributors upon the merging of a pull request and the creation of a new version.

4. The OWNER will notify all contributors about any changes in the revenue distribution and ensure that all contributors receive their fair share in a timely manner following any new commercial agreements.

5. Before a contribution is merged, the contributor must enter into a signed revenue-sharing agreement with the OWNER outlining the terms of their fair share of revenue from commercial licenses. Contributions will not be merged without this agreement in place.

6. Waiver of Fair Share: Contributors who do not wish to receive a fair share of revenue may submit a written waiver, explicitly stating their desire to contribute without compensation. Such waivers will be kept on file, and these contributions may be merged without a revenue-sharing agreement.  
 **Waiver Template**:  
 
        I, [Contributor's Name], hereby waive my right to receive any fair share  of revenue generated from commercial licenses of [Software Name]. I understand that my contributions will be accepted without a revenue-sharing agreement.

        Contributor's Signature: _______________________ Date: ________________________________________
        
7. Merging Decisions: The decision to merge any contribution rests solely with the OWNER. Contributions may be accepted or denied for any reason, at the sole discretion of the OWNER.

### Redistribution

Redistribution of the SOFTWARE in its original form or modified form is permitted, provided that this copyright notice is reproduced in all copies and proper attribution is given to the OWNER and contributors. However, redistribution for commercial purposes requires express written permission.

### Compliance with LGPL

When using this SOFTWARE, which may include components licensed under the LGPL, the following conditions apply:

1. If the SOFTWARE dynamically links to any LGPL-licensed libraries (such as Qt or Eigen), the library must be provided alongside the SOFTWARE, and users must be able to replace it with a different version.
2. Users should have access to the LGPL library's source code, which can be obtained from the library's official distribution.
3. The LGPL library must be used in a way that does not impose additional restrictions on users beyond those contained in the LGPL itself.
